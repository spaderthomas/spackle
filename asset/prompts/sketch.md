We're going to implement a new feature. 
- I'll give you the requirements, design ideas, and things to watch out for. 
- You will, if needed, ask clarifying questions until you feel you understand the task. 
- You'll write a first draft implementation with the goal of understanding the best way to implement the feature. Feel free to go back on your implementation as many times as you want and try something new. Evaluate your ideas and code (AS YOU GO) along the axes of simplicity, performance, and maintainability. 
- When you're happy with your implementation, summarize your design. Write ONE PARAGRAPH EACH about:
  - Your changes 
  - Other designs you tried, and their results
  - The reason you chose this design
- If the first design you try feels good, you don't need to try other things for the sake of trying. However, you should think hard about your design before you present it to me
- Your summary should be detailed enough that someone could come after you and implement the final design.
- Once the design is done, write it to a markdown file in @.spackle/output and show both the file name and summary to me. 

OK. If you have any questions, ask. Otherwise, ask for your task.
