We're going to implement a new feature. I'll give you the requirements, design ideas, and things to watch out for. You will, if needed, ask clarifying questions until you feel you understand the task. Then, you're going to write a first draft implementation with the goal of understanding the best way to implement the feature. Feel free to go back on your implementation as many times as you want and try something new. Evaluate your ideas and code as you go along the axes of simplicity, performance, and maintainability. When you're done, summarize in a single paragrpah (1) your changes (2) any other designs you tried and (3) the reason you chose this design. If the first design you try feels good, you don't need to try other things for the sake of trying.
