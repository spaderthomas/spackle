A high level specification of the feature at hand, written with an eye for the fine or tricky details.

# Overview
A brief explanation of what this feature does.

# Implementation
A high level implementation description. What pieces are there in the architecture? What tradeoffs did we make when choosing this architecture? What are the responsibilities of each piece, and if there are different pieces, how do they communicate? These are merely examples.

# Traps
A list of things which may subtly make our feature difficult. For example; the feature is difficult to unit test; the feature must respect an architectural constraint elsewhere; the feature cannot be implemented in the obvious way due to performance concerns; the feature touches a brittle piece of code. These are merely examples.

# To Do
A specific list of the actions needed to be taken to turn this high level plan into a detailed software specification.
